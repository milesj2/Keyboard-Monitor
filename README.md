# Keyboard-Monitor

For use with Ubuntu and a 2-in-1 laptop with a removable keyboard, where the on-screen keyboard keeps appearing on click, even with a keyboard attached.
This checks to see if the keyboard is still connected, enabling/disabling the on-screen keyboard as necccessary.

## Prerequisites:
Gnome extension block caribou is used to stop on-screen keyboard appearing when its disabled [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3222/block-caribou-36/).

## Install:
Steps for starting script on reboot:<br>
    * Open Startuo Applications.<br>
    * Here Click the Add Button.<br>
    * Give it a name and in the command put "{path to python} {path to location of downloaded script}".<br>
    * Done<br>
<br>
And that's it.
